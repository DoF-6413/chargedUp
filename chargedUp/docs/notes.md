## Nancy
- I set up the new camera onto minnie. I changed the name of the previous camera and named the new one the same as the previous one. This way I was still able to run the code that was on minnie using the new camera. Then I **calibrated the new camera to read the apriltags in 3D** and tested that minnie was still able to move and do the autonomous command that I told it to do in the code using the new camera. 


- **The new arducam is named "logi...."**
